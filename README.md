# hello-world

hi suckers!

I have no idea what I'm doing right now and the stupid Data Incubator asks me to use Heroku for hosting to do my project proposal--Again, I have no idea what that means! Don't ask me why I am learning to use GitHub, I guess that's because it has some kind of relationship with Heroku. Or mayby I'm wrong and that would be fantastic becuase it means I have been wasting almost one hour on this shit. 

God bless me.
